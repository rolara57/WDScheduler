# WDSchedule
User story
As a employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

Application
When the planner is opened the day is displayed at the top of the calender. As you scroll down you are presented with time blocks for that day. Each time block is color-coded to indicate if the time block is past, present or future. when you select a time you are able to enter a event and save the event using a save button and teh event will be stored in your local storage.

Technologies  used:
HTML5, CSS and Javascript

Launch;
Easy to use: Open, select time remembering light red text field is current time. Lightgray is past and Lightgreen is future.
click on save and the message is saved to your local storage.

References;
Due to my inexperience I had to use extensive Google searches and one that led me to Madhumitha Prabakaran work on a day planner project. I used this homework more as a study guide and learned on how to structure a project, research different methods and why certain code was used. I manipulated the structure and tried different ways to get the same results. Other sites used was momentjs.com,w3schools, stackoverflow and a few more.
